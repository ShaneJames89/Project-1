# Testing

- I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox & Safari.
- I confirmed that the project is repsponsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar
- I confirmed that the navigation, header, about us, sign up and contact text are all readable and easy to understand.
- I have confirmed that the form works: requires entries in every field, will only accept an email in the email field, and the submit button works.

 **Bugs**

##### **Solved bugs**

- When I tried to load images from Gallery on web browser images wouldn't load so I made adjustments to file names which enable images to load correctly.
- I added hypens in between each words in the file so the images would load correctly.

 **Validator Testing**

 - HTML
   - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.
 - CSS
   - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.
 - Accessibility
   - I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.
