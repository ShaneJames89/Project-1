           <hr>
           <ol>
            <li><b>Mindfulness Meditation:</b> This technique involves focusing your attention on the present moment, observing your thoughts and sensations without judgment. It cultivates awareness and helps you develop a non-reactive and accepting mindset.</li>
            <li><b>Loving-Kindness Meditation:</b> This practice involves directing well-wishes and positive intentions towards yourself, loved ones, neutral individuals, and even difficult people. It promotes compassion, empathy, and a sense of interconnectedness with others.</li>
            <li><b>Guided Visualization:</b> This technique uses visual imagery to create a relaxing and peaceful mental environment. It often involves imagining serene landscapes, healing light, or positive affirmations to reduce stress and enhance well-being.</li>
            <li><b>Body Scan Meditation:</b> This practice involves systematically scanning your body from head to toe, bringing attention and awareness to each part. It helps promote relaxation, release tension, and develop a deeper connection with your physical sensations.</li>
            <li><b>Breathing Meditation:</b> This technique focuses on observing and regulating your breath. It involves paying attention to the inhalation and exhalation, deepening the breath, and using it as an anchor to stay present and calm.</li>
            <li><b>Transcendental Meditation:</b> This technique involves the use of a personalized mantra to achieve a state of deep relaxation and inner peace. It aims to access a state of pure consciousness beyond regular thinking processes.</li>

          <h2>Stages <i class="far fa-smile"></i></h2>
          <hr>
          <ol>
          <li><b>Concentration:</b> In this stage, the practitioner focuses their attention on a single point of focus, such as the breath, a mantra, or a visual object. The goal is to develop the ability to sustain concentration and minimize distractions.</li>
          <li><b>Insight:</b> Once a certain level of concentration is achieved, the practitioner enters the stage of insight. In this stage, one cultivates mindfulness and awareness of the present moment, observing thoughts, emotions, and sensations without judgment. Insights into the nature of reality and the self may arise during this stage.</li>
          <li><b>Absorption or Tranquility:</b> In this stage, often referred to as "absorption" or "tranquility," the practitioner experiences deep states of calm, stillness, and inner peace. The mind becomes highly focused and unified, and there is a sense of deep relaxation and bliss. This stage can lead to profound states of meditation known as jhana or samadhi.</li>
